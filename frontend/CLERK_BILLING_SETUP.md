# Clerk Billing Integration Setup

## Overview
This application now uses Clerk's billing system for secure payment processing instead of Stripe. The checkout system integrates with Clerk's authentication and provides a seamless payment experience.

## Features
- ✅ **Secure Authentication**: Uses Clerk for user authentication
- ✅ **Integrated Billing**: Payment processing through Clerk's system
- ✅ **Real-time Orders**: Creates orders in Convex database
- ✅ **Tax Calculation**: Automatic 8% tax calculation
- ✅ **Shipping Logic**: Free shipping over $50, $5.99 otherwise

## How It Works

### 1. User Authentication
- Users sign in through Clerk authentication
- User profiles are automatically created in Convex
- Seamless integration between Clerk and Convex

### 2. Checkout Process
1. **Shipping Information**: Collect delivery details
2. **Payment Form**: Secure card input with Clerk
3. **Order Processing**: Payment confirmation and order creation
4. **Success**: Order confirmation and cart clearing

### 3. Payment Flow
```
User Input → Clerk Payment Intent → Payment Confirmation → Order Creation → Success
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure you have these environment variables set:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
```

### Clerk Dashboard Setup
1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Navigate to **Billing** section
3. Configure payment methods and webhooks
4. Set up your business information

## File Structure
```
frontend/src/
├── components/
│   └── Checkout.tsx          # Main checkout component
├── config/
│   └── clerk.ts              # Clerk configuration
└── hooks/
    └── useConvex.ts          # Convex integration
```

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Checkout Flow
1. Navigate to `/medicine` and add items to cart
2. Go to `/cart` and click "Proceed to Checkout"
3. Fill in shipping information
4. Complete payment form
5. Verify order creation in Convex

### 3. Test Data
Use these test card numbers:
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002

## Security Features
- ✅ **Secure Input**: All payment data is handled securely
- ✅ **Authentication Required**: Users must be signed in
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Form validation on all fields
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback

## Customization

### Tax Rates
Modify tax calculation in `frontend/src/config/clerk.ts`:
```typescript
tax: {
  enabled: true,
  rate: 0.08, // Change to your tax rate
}
```

### Shipping Rules
Adjust shipping logic in the same file:
```typescript
shipping: {
  freeThreshold: 50, // Free shipping threshold
  standardRate: 5.99, // Standard shipping rate
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Payment Failed**: Check Clerk dashboard for errors
2. **Order Not Created**: Verify Convex connection
3. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure Clerk is properly configured

### Debug Mode
